Platform-specific SDL API functions. These are functions that deal with
needs of specific operating systems, that didn't make sense to offer as
platform-independent, generic APIs.

Most apps can make do without these functions, but they can be useful for
integrating with other parts of a specific system, adding platform-specific
polish to an app, or solving problems that only affect one target.
