This file contains functions to set and get configuration hints, as well as
listing each of them alphabetically.

The convention for naming hints is SDL_HINT_X, where "SDL_X" is the
environment variable that can be used to override the default.

In general these hints are just that - they may or may not be supported or
applicable on any given platform, but they provide a way for an application
or user to give the library a hint as to how they would like the library to
work.
