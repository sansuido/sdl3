/// this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to
/// work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy
/// of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.
/// - On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
/// context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.
/// This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you
/// look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that
/// is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually
/// available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the
/// existence of the appropriate extension with SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(),
/// or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function
/// as core functionality.
/// - Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return NULL if a function
/// isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for
/// extensions you use, and if you get a NULL anyway, act as if that
/// extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you

/// - Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
/// Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not
